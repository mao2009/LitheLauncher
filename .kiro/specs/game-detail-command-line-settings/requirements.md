## Requirements

### Requirement 1: 繧ｳ繝槭Φ繝峨Λ繧､繝ｳ險ｭ螳壹・蜈･蜉帙→豌ｸ邯壼喧
**Objective:** As a user, I want to define custom command-line arguments for a game in its detail screen, so that I can customize how the game is launched.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  When a user opens the game detail screen, the LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall display an input field for command-line settings.
2.  When a user enters text into the command-line settings input field, the LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall store this text as part of the game's metadata.
3.  When a user saves the game details, the LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall persist the command-line settings associated with the game.
4.  While the game detail screen is open for an existing game, the LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall pre-populate the command-line settings input field with the game's saved command-line settings.

### Requirement 2: `%command%` 繝励Ξ繝ｼ繧ｹ繝帙Ν繝繝ｼ縺ｮ蜃ｦ逅・**Objective:** As the system, I want to correctly interpret the `%command%` placeholder in the command-line settings, so that the game executable is inserted at the user-specified position.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  When the command-line settings string contains `"%command%"`, the LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall replace `"%command%"` with the full path to the game's executable.
2.  When the command-line settings string does not contain `"%command%"`, the LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall prepend the full path to the game's executable to the command-line string.
3.  The LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall pass the processed command-line string to the operating system for game execution.

### Requirement 3: 繧ｳ繝槭Φ繝峨Λ繧､繝ｳ蠑墓焚繧剃ｼｴ縺・ご繝ｼ繝縺ｮ襍ｷ蜍・**Objective:** As a user, I want to launch a game with its custom command-line settings, so that the game starts with the desired configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  When a user launches a game from the LitheLauncher Game Launcher, the LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall retrieve the game's saved command-line settings.
2.  When the LitheLauncher Game Launcher executes the game, it shall include the processed command-line settings as arguments for the game executable.

### Requirement 4: 繧ｳ繝槭Φ繝峨Λ繧､繝ｳ險ｭ螳壹・繝舌Μ繝・・繧ｷ繝ｧ繝ｳ
**Objective:** As a user, I want to be informed about potentially problematic command-line settings, so that I can correct them before launching the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  If the command-line settings contain syntax that could lead to execution errors (e.g., mismatched quotes, unrecognized special characters beyond `%command%`), the LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall display a warning to the user in the game detail screen.
2.  The LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall allow the user to save and attempt to launch the game even with warnings, but shall log any execution errors.
