## Requirements

### 1. 繝ｦ繝九・繧ｯ隴伜挨蟄・(GUID/Identifier) 縺ｮ逕滓・縺ｨ蜑ｲ繧雁ｽ薙※
**Objective:** As a system, I want to ensure every game has a unique identifier, so that games can be consistently identified across different contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. When a new game is registered, the LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall automatically generate and assign a unique identifier (GUID) to the game.
2. If a game is loaded from persistent storage and does not have a unique identifier, then the LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall automatically generate and assign a unique identifier to that game.
3. The unique identifier shall be a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) or an equivalent globally unique string.

### 2. 繝ｦ繝九・繧ｯ隴伜挨蟄舌・豌ｸ邯壼喧
**Objective:** As a system, I want to store the unique identifier, so that game identification is consistent across application sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. When a unique identifier is assigned to a game, the LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall persistently store this identifier in the game's metadata within the database.
2. While a game's unique identifier is stored, the LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall retrieve the unique identifier when the game's details are accessed.

### 3. 繝ｦ繝九・繧ｯ隴伜挨蟄舌↓繧医ｋ繧ｲ繝ｼ繝縺ｮ讀懃ｴ｢縺ｨ謫堺ｽ・**Objective:** As a system, I want to allow game operations based on the unique identifier, so that games can be managed independently of their internal database IDs.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. When provided with a unique identifier, the LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall retrieve the corresponding game's details.
2. When provided with a unique identifier, the LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall allow updating of the corresponding game's details.
3. When provided with a unique identifier, the LitheLauncher Game Launcher shall allow deletion of the corresponding game.
